3.2 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions in an environment by maximizing a reward signal. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions, and uses this feedback to improve its decision-making over time.
In RL, the agent interacts with an environment, where it selects actions to perform based on its current state. The environment then transitions to a new state and the agent receives a reward or penalty for its action. The agent's goal is to learn a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions, that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.
One of the key components of RL is the use of a value function, which estimates the expected cumulative reward for a given state or state-action pair. The agent can use this value function to guide its decision-making, by selecting actions that lead to states with high estimated values.
A popular algorithm for RL is Q-learning, which is a type of model-free, off-policy RL algorithm. Q-learning uses a Q-table to store the estimated values for all state-action pairs. At each time step, the agent selects the action that maximizes the Q-value for its current state. The Q-values are then updated using the Bellman equation, which expresses the Q-value for a state-action pair in terms of the Q-values for the next state.
 avoiding holes. The Q-table is initialized with all zeros, and the learning parameters are set to alpha = 0.1 and gamma = 0.9. The agent uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to select actions, where it selects the action with the highest Q-value with probability (1-epsilon) and a random action with probability epsilon. The Q-values are updated using the Bellman equation at each time step.
